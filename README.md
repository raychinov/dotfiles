# dotfiles

This repository is used to keep my configuration files safe and synchronized, to share
knowledge with others and get some hands-on experience with GitHub. At this point I use
the repo mainly for bash aliases, Vim and Conky, but I intend to do more with it.
Feel free to contact me if something here catches your eye.
